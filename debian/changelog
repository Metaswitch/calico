calico (0.6) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Many fixes and enhancements to Felix (the new Calico agent)
    - IP v6 support and minor bug fixes.
    - Minor logging enhancement.
    - Fix dull bug where we never left long enough for resync responses to return on a slow system, ignoring the config values.
    - Many more updates. Apart from intermittent iptables issues, mostly working well. Next action is to fix those.
    - Finally fix dull issue with python-iptables, state and IPv6.
    - Add ep_retry code.
    - Fix small bugette in handling of endpoint retry.
    - Stop using "state" completely - "conntrack" seems more reliable.
    - Fix up bug where we created IPv6 sets as IPv4, then crashed.
    - GETACLUPDATE response may arrive before tap interface created; handle it.
    - Speculative fix for problem with icmp ip6tables rules.
    - Do not get confused during second resync and delete endpoints.
    - Allow for the state of endpoints to be disabled.
    - Subscribe to ACL heartbeats to avoid timing it out continuously.
    - Minor cosmetic edits.
    - More minor refactoring and code tidy up.
    - Remove IPs from an endpoint when they are removed by the API. Also, some minor code tidies.
    - Clean up logic when removing unused IPs.
    - Fix up dull typo in IP removal code.
    - Fix bug where tap address got wrong MAC address.
    - Put in candidate workaround for looping in iptables configuration.
  * Packaging: calico-felix needs dependency on python-dev(el)
  * RPM packaging fixes
    - Start and stop Calico services on install/uninstall
    - Run Calico services as root, not as 'neutron'
  * ACL Manager fix
    - ACL manager was sending a three part message for keepalives. Make it a two part message like the others.
