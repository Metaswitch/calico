Description: Project Calico virtual networking for cloud data centers.
 Project Calico is an open source solution for virtual networking in
 cloud data centers. Its IP-centric architecture offers numerous
 advantages over other cloud networking approaches such as VLANs and
 overlays, including scalability, efficiency, and simplicity. It is
 designed for a wide range of environments including OpenStack,
 lightweight Linux containers (LXCs), bare metal, and Network Functions
 Virtualization (NFV).
 .
 This package provides the pieces needed on a compute node.
